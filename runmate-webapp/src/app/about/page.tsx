          About RunMate
        </h1>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-300">
          RunMate is an app designed to match up runners of similar levels and
          goals, allowing them to connect and run together. We believe that
          running with others can be a powerful motivator and a great way to
          stay safe and consistent.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-300">
          Running clubs can sometimes be intimidating for newcomers. RunMate
          aims to level the playing field, removing the fear of "what if Iâ€™m not
          fast enough?" and allowing you to enjoy social runs with people who
          are looking for the same thing.
